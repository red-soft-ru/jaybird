	This package contains classes defining Firebird API for Java language
	that applications can use to access databases directly without JDBC 
	interfaces. This is probably most efficient way to access the database, 
	however also it is the most complicated one and requires deep knowledge
	of the Firebird API. For better understanding please refer to the 
	"InterBase 6 API Guide" published by Borland and released together with
	the open-sourcing the InterBase code, a predecessor of Firebird.

	Please refer to the documentation in the javadoc comments as well as 
	to the source code for more information.
